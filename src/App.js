            Kevin spearheaded development of Voice Communication System, a
            peer-to-peer radio simulation and voice communications software
            suite. He led the development team and was responsible for overall
            product design. Kevin and his team proved value in a matter of
            months, offsetting significant installation costs by replacing a
            commercial-off-the-shelf system. Kevin went on to deploy the
            solution in several facilities, reducing setup and maintenance costs
            for simulation events.
